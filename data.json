            "ingredients" : "½ lb (700 g) lean (90%) ground beef\n1 pkg (1-1.25 oz/30-35 g) taco seasoning mix\n1¾ cups (7 oz/200 g) shredded cheddar cheese, divided\n2 tbsp (45 mL) water\n 2 pkg (8 oz /250 g each) refrigerated crescent rolls\n1   egg white, lightly beaten\nOptional toppings: salsa, shredded lettuce, chopped onion and tomato, sliced olives, and sour cream",
            "directions": "Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the ground beef in a 5-qt. (4.7-L) Brilliance Nonstick Saute Pan over medium heat for 10-12 minutes or until it's no longer pink, breaking beef into crumbles, then drain. Transfer the beef to a Classic Batter Bowl. Stir in the taco seasoning mix, 1 ½ cups of the cheese, and water.\nUnroll the crescent dough and separate it into 16 triangles. Arrange the triangles, slightly overlapping, in a circle on a Pizza Stone with the wide ends of the triangles overlapping in the center and points toward the outside. There should be a 5 inch (13-cm)-diameter opening in the center of the stone. The narrow triangle points of dough will extend off the edge of the baking stone.\nUsing a Large Scoop, scoop the filling evenly over the dough in a continuous circle. Bring the points of triangles up over the filling and tuck them under the dough at center to form a ring. (Filling will show.) Brush the top with the egg white. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until it is golden brown. Serve with toppings."
