            "directions": "1). Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the ground beef in a 5-qt. (4.7-L) Brilliance Nonstick Saute Pan over medium heat for 10-12 minutes or until it's no longer pink, breaking beef into crumbles, then drain. Transfer the beef to a Classic Batter Bowl. Stir in the taco seasoning mix, 1 ½ cups of the cheese, and water.\n2). Unroll the crescent dough and separate it into 16 triangles. Arrange the triangles, slightly overlapping, in a circle on a Pizza Stone with the wide ends of the triangles overlapping in the center and points toward the outside. There should be a 5 inch (13-cm)-diameter opening in the center of the stone. The narrow triangle points of dough will extend off the edge of the baking stone.\n3). Using a Large Scoop, scoop the filling evenly over the dough in a continuous circle. Bring the points of triangles up over the filling and tuck them under the dough at center to form a ring. (Filling will show.) Brush the top with the egg white. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until it is golden brown. Serve with toppings."
